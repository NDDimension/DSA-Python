"""
Queue Data Structure Implementation Using Arrays (Circular Queue)

Overview:
---------
A Queue is a linear data structure that follows the **FIFO (First-In-First-Out)** principle.
This means the element inserted first is the one to be removed first â€” much like a queue
of people standing in line.

In this implementation, we use a **fixed-size array (Python list)** to build a **circular queue**,
which efficiently uses space by wrapping around the end of the list when needed.

Queue Operations:
-----------------
1. Enqueue: Add an element to the rear of the queue.
2. Dequeue: Remove and return the element at the front of the queue.
3. Peek: View the element at the front without removing it.
4. is_empty: Check whether the queue is empty.
5. is_full: Check whether the queue is full.
6. display: Print all elements in the queue from front to rear.

Circular Queue:
---------------
This implementation uses modulo arithmetic to wrap the `front` and `rear` pointers around
when they reach the end of the array. This allows the queue to reuse previously freed space.

Time Complexity:
----------------
- Enqueue: O(1)
- Dequeue: O(1)
- Peek:    O(1)
- Display: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the queue.

Common Use Cases:
-----------------
- Job scheduling
- Printer queue management
- Handling asynchronous data (like IO Buffers)
- BFS (Breadth-First Search) in graphs

This module is intended for educational purposes or basic queue usage where fixed capacity is sufficient.

"""
Dynamic Queue Implementation Using collections.deque

Overview:
---------
This module implements a Queue using Python's built-in `collections.deque`, which provides
an efficient way to perform queue operations in constant time (O(1)).

Unlike array-based (fixed-size) queues, this implementation is **dynamic**, meaning the queue 
can grow or shrink as needed without predefined capacity. This is ideal for general-purpose
applications where the number of elements isn't fixed in advance.

Queue Operations:
-----------------
1. Enqueue: Add an element to the rear of the queue.
2. Dequeue: Remove and return the element at the front of the queue.
3. Peek: View the element at the front without removing it.
4. is_empty: Check whether the queue is empty.
5. size: Return the number of elements in the queue.
6. display: Print all elements from front to rear.

Time Complexity:
----------------
- Enqueue: O(1)
- Dequeue: O(1)
- Peek:    O(1)
- Display: O(n), where n is the number of elements

Advantages:
-----------
- No need to manage front/rear pointers or handle overflow.
- More readable and maintainable.
- Dynamically resizable, unlike fixed-size array-based implementations.

Common Use Cases:
-----------------
- Event-driven programming
- Message queues
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Producer-consumer problems

Note:
-----
Although `deque` supports operations at both ends, this implementation only uses one end 
for enqueue and the other for dequeue, staying true to FIFO behavior.
