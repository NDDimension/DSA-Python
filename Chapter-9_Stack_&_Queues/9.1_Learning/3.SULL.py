"""
Stack Implementation Using Singly Linked List in Python

Overview:
---------
A Stack is a linear data structure that follows the **LIFO (Last-In, First-Out)** principle.
This means the most recently added element is the first one to be removed â€” like a stack of plates.

This implementation uses a **singly linked list** to represent the stack dynamically.
Each element (node) points to the next one, and elements are added and removed from the head
of the list to ensure O(1) time complexity for push and pop operations.

Advantages:
-----------
- Dynamic memory allocation: No need to define a maximum size.
- Efficient push and pop operations (O(1)).
- Useful when the number of elements isn't known in advance.

Stack Operations:
-----------------
1. push(data): Adds a new element to the top of the stack.
2. pop(): Removes and returns the top element from the stack.
3. peek(): Returns the top element without removing it.
4. is_empty(): Checks whether the stack is empty.
5. display(): Prints the current elements in the stack from top to bottom.

Time Complexity:
----------------
- Push: O(1)
- Pop:  O(1)
- Peek: O(1)
- Display: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the stack.

Common Use Cases:
-----------------
- Function call stack
- Undo/Redo operations
- Expression evaluation (e.g., postfix, infix)
- Backtracking algorithms
