"""
Task Scheduler (LeetCode 621)

Given a list of tasks (uppercase letters) and a non-negative cooldown n,
return the least number of intervals needed to finish all tasks such that
the same task appears at least n intervals apart.

Edge cases:
- n = 0 -> answer is len(tasks)
- Many tasks tied for max frequency
- Empty tasks -> 0

Examples:
- tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2
  -> 8
  One valid schedule: A B idle A B idle A B

- tasks = ["A","C","A","B","D","B"], n = 1
  -> 6
  One valid schedule: A B C A B D

- tasks = ["A","A","A","A","B","C","D","E","F","G"], n = 2
  -> 10
  One valid schedule: A B C A D E A F G A

- tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 50
  -> 104  (idles dominate)

       - Count frequencies of tasks.
       - Use a max-heap to always schedule the task with the highest remaining count.
       - Use a queue to keep tasks that are cooling down with their "available time".
       - Each time unit:
         - Release any task whose cooldown expired back to the heap.
         - If heap not empty, schedule one task (decrement count); if it remains, put it into cooldown with next available time t + n + 1.
         - If heap empty but cooldown not, it's an idle.
