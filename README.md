🚀 My Python implementations of Striver's A2Z DSA Sheet — with in-code explanations, topic-wise structure, and a step-by-step progress tracker.

# 🧠 Striver's A2Z DSA Sheet in Python

Welcome to my journey through the **Striver's A2Z DSA Sheet**, implemented entirely in **Python**. This repository contains well-documented solutions with explanations, written as part of my structured learning path for mastering Data Structures and Algorithms.

## 📌 What is This Repo About?

This is a curated collection of my solutions to the [Striver A2Z DSA Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/interviews/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-structure-and-details/), a step-by-step roadmap to mastering DSA concepts.

Each problem is solved in Python, with:
- 💡 In-code **docstring notes** explaining the logic, edge cases, and reasoning.
- 📁 Organized **folder-wise** according to topic/step.
- ✅ Regular updates as I progress through the sheet.

---

## 🧠 My Learning Methodology

- Solve each problem on **LeetCode**.
- Write Python solutions from scratch.
- Include **docstrings** that:
  - Explain the approach
  - Mention time/space complexity
  - Discuss edge cases (when needed)
- Push after completing each step/topic.
