Patterns requires the concept of "Nested Loops"

Rules for creating a certain pattern:

    1.  Outer loop is for the number of lines.

    2.  Inner loop is for the content or we can say the content of the pattern 
         and one must connect the inner loop to the outer loop somehow.

    3.  Anything to be printed must be written inside the inner loop.

    4.  Observer symmetry ( applicable to few patterns ).
